## Example: Singular Value Decomposition of an Image
In this example, we decompose a test image into frames using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Note:
1. This exampleâ€™s codes are in the `SVD-Notebook.ipynb` notebook.
1. The notebook _should_ download (and compile) the required packages for you and load all the required codes
1. The frames (image fragments reconstructed from the SVD) are saved in the `frames` directory.
