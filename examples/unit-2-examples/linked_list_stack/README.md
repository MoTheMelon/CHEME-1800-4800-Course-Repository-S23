## Linked list example
We implement a stack data structure using a linked list in this example. 

### Files:
* The definitions of the `push!` and `pop!` operations and the node and stack type definitions are in the file `Stack.jl` in the `src` directory
* The `Include.jl` file sets some local path variables, loads external packages with `using` statements, and loads our code files
* The `runme.jl` file creates and populates an example stack.
