## Lab-4b: Analysis of the Recursive Quick Sort Algorithm

### Objectives
The objective of `lab-4b` is to familiarize students with recursion, the divide and conquer paradigm, and their use for useful tasks such as sorting. 
Unlike the previous sorting approaches we explored, e.g., [Bubble sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJLwnsLn0_Q), [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) uses recursion to sort lists.

### Algorithm
[Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is an efficient, general-purpose recursive sorting algorithm for arrays originally [published in 1961](https://doi.org/10.1145/366622.366644). Quicksort uses a divide-and-conquer paradigm in which a `pivot` element is selected from the array; then, the array is partitioned into two subarrays containing smaller and larger elements than the pivot element (the divide step). Finally, each subarray is then recursively sorted (the conquer step).

The time complexity of [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) depends strongly on the value of the pivot element. The worst-case time complexity (when the pivot element is the smallest or biggest element) will be $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. However, on average, we'd expect [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) to run in $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot\log(n))$ time. 

### Tasks
1. Break up into groups and explain/analyze the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) implementation in `QuickSort.jl`. 
1. Sort a set of random vectors of length `l = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256` created using the `rand()` command. Record the mean and standard deviation of the execution time for the `quicksort` implementation as a function of the arrayâ€™s length using the [BenchmarkTools](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) package.
