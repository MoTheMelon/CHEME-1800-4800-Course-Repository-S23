## Lab-4d: Working with text data files. Ham or Spam?

### Data
The data set we'll use is taken from the [Spam or Ham competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download). We've changed the column labels to 'label' and 'message' (from 'v1' and 'v2') and removed the last three empty columns.
