## Lab-5d: Two-dimensional Cellular Automata Simulation
A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation. A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as `on` and `off`. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology, and microstructure modeling. 

A set of cells called its neighborhood is defined for each cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1) according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the latest state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. 

Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell, does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously. However, exceptions, such as the stochastic cellular automaton and asynchronous cellular automaton, are known.
